The Image Processor Tool is a batch processing tool that will allow a user to select a list of
directories, and perform a series of “Image Actions” on all image files within those directories.
These actions can be as simple as saving a PNG file in a compressed state, verifying your
image is a power of 2 or verifying images meet the proper PBR standards of your studio.
Image Actions are flexible and can be added easily by any Technical Artist or Programmer. Once the new
action is written, it will automatically appear in the Optional Actions section of the tool’s UI.
